---

Welcome to **Reverie**, an elegant blog theme inspired by the classic Jekyll theme. This is a sample post to demonstrate the features of this blog.

## LaTeX Support

This blog supports LaTeX math rendering using KaTeX. Here are some examples:

Inline math: $E = mc^2$

Display math:
$$
\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} e^{-x^2} dx = \sqrt{\pi}
$$

The quadratic formula:
$$
x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}
$$

## Images

You can add images to your posts. Place them in the `public/images/` directory and reference them in markdown:

```markdown
![Alt text](/images/cat.png)
```

Here's an example:

![A cute cat](/images/cat.png)

## Typography

This theme features beautiful serif typography for the body text and clean sans-serif for headings and navigation. The design focuses on readability and letting your content shine.

## Blockquotes

> Sometimes, your post just stands for itself and doesn't need a title. And that's fine, too!

## Code

You can include code snippets in your posts:

```javascript
function greet(name) {
  console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
}
```

```python
def greet(name):
  print(f"Hello, {name}!")
```

The code snippets are styled beautifully and support syntax highlighting.

## Lists

You can create ordered lists:

1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item

And unordered lists:

- Item one
- Item two
- Item three

Enjoy writing and sharing your thoughts with this elegant theme!
