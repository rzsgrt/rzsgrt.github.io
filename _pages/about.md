Hi, I'm Reza and currently I work as Data Scientist at [Mekari](https://mekari.com/) (SaaS company in Indonesia). In high level, it means I work from data collection, build-train predictive model and prepare deployment (in another terms, end-to-end machine learning/data scientist). For more about my working experience, you can go to my [linkedin page](https://www.linkedin.com/in/reza-sugiarto/) or my [notion page](https://s.id/1w2T4).

If you find and wonder what this blog about, this blog meant to record everything I learned. So my post will range from one line linux command post to one long paper summary (hopefully). Aaanndd if you learn something from this blog, please take it with a grain of salt. I hope I can provide with reputable source so you can check to original source.

In case you need to discuss something with me, you can find me at
