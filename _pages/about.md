Hi, I'm Reza! ðŸ‘‹

I'm passionate about using artificial intelligence and data science to solve real-world problems. What excites me most is seeing how AI can transform businesses and improve user experiences in meaningful ways.

This blog reflects my learning philosophy: everything is worth documenting, whether it's a one-line Linux command that saved my day or an in-depth analysis of a machine learning paper. If you find something useful here, that's great! Just remember to verify the information - tech moves fast, and what works today might need updating tomorrow.

Want to chat about AI, data science, or anything tech-related? Feel free to reach out:
