title: 'What my brain plays on leg day: Life is about movement'
categories: [counterfactual, interpretable machine learning]

You know what it feels between sets on leg day: it hurts, and you almost lose your breath. I wonder about the origin of creation leg day. What kind of people enjoy doing leg exercises. So, my brain ask between my sets: Why am I doing this? I can spend this time reading or watching movie. Why do I choose to hurt my leg??

Then I realize, ohhhh what if life is about movement???? and I’m not talking only about physical movement. Okay, Maybe this idea already been proposed by someone else, but let me share my three body model (yes, I got inspiration from physics problem, but no, it’s different).

Okay, so there are three body: the physical body, the intelligent body, and the emotional body.

When I say movement, it’s about moving from point A to point B. It’s easy to explain for the physical body. You walk from one coffee shop to another. You squat (who tf invented this exercise).But what about the intelligent and the emotional body?

Well, I think intelligent movement is when you move from not understanding to understanding it. For example, first time I read fasttext paper, I had no idea hierarchical softmax meant. After several complementary resources (and spending time), I moved from having no idea about hierarchical softmax to getting the idea. Do I know it perfectly? No! But at least I can explain what kind of problem the idea is trying to solve and how it works. It’s impossible to know about everything, but at least we reduce our unknown unknowns region and expand known knowns (also our known unknowns).

Next, the emotional body. Well, maybe I got this reference because I recently watched Inside Out 2. They introduce several emotions in that movie (this is not spoiler; they put it in trailer). Okay, maybe (I don’t know precisely) the emotional range is much shorter than the knowledge you can explore for your intelligent body. But, as you can see in Inside Out 2, we shouldn’t define ourselves by one emotion. Movement here means allowing yourself to feel.

Unlike the natural growth of our body as we age, I believe we should actively grow and cultivate these three body. In some situations, each body grows at the same time. For example, when you go to library, its physical movement and intelligent (well, that happens if you read and not sleeping at library).

Explaining the concept of identity using these model is easy: Your identity is fusion of these three bodies. And because everyone has different capacities in each body, it makes our identities unique.
